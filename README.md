#Reflow Issues

Adobe Edge Reflow is a modern design tool for creating responsive web sites.  This Github repo does not include code for Edge Reflow. This repository will be used to track issues and feedback reported to our team by the public. Please feel free to file issues regarding functionality that you would like to see or functionality that is simply not behaving correctly.
Issues filed by our customers will be evaluated and addressed in a timely manner by the Reflow development team. We hope that hosting our issues on Github will motivate folks to give us their feedback to enable us to build a better tool.

For instructions on filing issues, you can go here:https://github.com/edge-reflow/issues/wiki/How-To-File-Reflow-Bugs.

In the future, we may provide samples, public downloads or other fun snippets for your enjoyment.
